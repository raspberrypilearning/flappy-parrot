## Make the pipes move

Next you're going to make the pipes move across the screen to create an obstacle course.

First make the pipes appear by adding code to the Pipes sprite so that, `when the green flag is clicked`{:class="block3events"}, the sprite `forever`{:class="block3control"} `creates a clone of itself`{:class="block3control"} every two seconds.

```blocks3
when green flag clicked
set size to (200) %
hide
forever 
  create clone of (myself v)
  wait (2) seconds
end
```

**Tip:** clones are just copies of a sprite, and they are really useful for creating games.

Next make the pipes move by adding code so that, `when a clone starts`{:class="block3control"}, the clone appears on the right side of the Stage and `glides`{:class="block3motion"} across to the left.

```blocks3
when I start as a clone
show
go to x: (240) y: (0)
glide (4) secs to x: (-240) y: (0)
delete this clone
```

**Tip:** you can stop the pipes scrolling by clicking the red **stop** button next to the green flag.

Now you should have lots of pipes, but their gaps are always in the same place.

You can add some variety by using a `random`{:class="block3operators"} number for the Pipes sprite's `y position`{:class="block3motion"}.

\--- task \---

Modify your sprite's code so that each sprite clone `picks a random number from -80 to 80`{:class="block3operators"} and `glides`{:class="block3motion"} to that `y position`{:class="block3motion"}:

```blocks3
when I start as a clone
show
+ go to x: (240) y: (pick random (-80) to (80))
+ glide (4) secs to x: (-240) y: (y position)
delete this clone
```
